**HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-ML**
Predicting employee attrition using machine learning. Includes EDA, data cleaning, model comparison, and business insights.

This project uses machine learning models to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company. Built with Python, the project includes data cleaning, EDA, model building, and insights that help HR teams take preventive actions.

 Tools & Tech
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

 Key Features
- Preprocessing HR data (handling nulls, encoding)
- Visualizing attrition by job role, satisfaction level etc
- Models: Logistic Regression

- the results:
- The analysis revealed several key factors influencing employee attrition. Higher job involvement is associated with significantly lower attrition rates, indicating that engaged employees are less likely to leave. Similarly, monthly income showed a negative correlation, suggesting that better-paid employees tend to stay longer. In contrast, employees working overtime are more likely to leave, highlighting a potential burnout factor. Longer tenure in the current role and extended time with the same manager both reduce the likelihood of attrition, emphasizing the importance of stability and strong managerial relationships. Conversely, a longer gap since the last promotion is positively correlated with attrition, indicating that delayed career progression may lead to dissatisfaction and increased turnover.
